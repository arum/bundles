<h1>Glue</h1>

<p>Glue is an OSGi bundle that provides an mechanism for OSGi
service based dependency injection.</p>

<p>To declare a component add the following manifest header to your
bundle referencing each class you want to be created and injected with
OSGi services:</p>
<code>Glueable-Component: fully.qualified.classname[(,
fully.qualified.classname)*]</code>

<p>As a minimum each component must implement {@link Glueable} and a
default constructor.</p>

<p>The activation lifecycle for a glueable component is as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bind all required/optional services. See {@link Glueable}</li>
	<li>Bind the bundle context if required. See {@link Contextual}</li>
	<li>Activate. See {@link Activatable}</li>
	<li>Register services. See {@link GlueableService}</li>
</ul>

<p>The deactivation lifecycle for a glueable component is
essentially the reverse of the above, as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Unregister services.</li>
	<li>Deactivate.</li>
	<li>Unbind the context.</li>
	<li>Unbind required/optional services.</li>
</ul>
